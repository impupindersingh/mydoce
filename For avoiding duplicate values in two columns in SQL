If this is needed in general (not only for this Insert), you should add a UNIQUE constraint on the (type, name) combination:

ALTER TABLE models
  ADD UNIQUE KEY type_name_U (type, name) ;

Then you can simply add rows and if the combination exists in the table, the Insert will fail:

INSERT INTO  models(type, name)
  VALUES (1, 'test') ;

For one-time check only, try this instead:

INSERT INTO  models(type, name)
  SELECT 1, 'test'
  FROM dual
  WHERE NOT EXISTS
        ( SELECT *
          FROM models
          WHERE type = 1 
            AND name = 'test'
        )
